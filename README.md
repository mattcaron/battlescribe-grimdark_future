How do I use these files?
=========================

If you've found this, this is the "source code" for the One Page Rules
Grimdark Future. If you just want to use these, just add following URL
as a repository location:

http://battlescribe.mattcaron.net/onepagerules/grimdark_future/index.bsi


Introduction
============

These datafiles are for the One Page Rules Grimdark Future ruleset, available
here:

https://onepagerules.wordpress.com/portfolio/grimdark-future/


How can I help?
===============

Pick an army and do a datafile for it. We coordinate efforts on the
forums (http://onepagerules.proboards.com/board/28/grimdark-future),
so we encourage you to drop in and ask quesitons there. If you speak
git, then feel free to commit your code on a branch and PR it on this
repository. If not, then you can post it in the forums and someone
will grab it and put it in the repo for you.

Guidelines
===============

1. The "Book" entry should contain the name of the list you're
implementing **including** the version (so we know what versions are
current).

1. You should never add anything to the game system file (.gst) that's
not in the main ruleset.

1. All upgrade lists should reference the letter for the upgrade
section, just to make it easier to keep track of things.

1. In the case of really complicated combinations, it is acceptable to
just make a list of all combinations. It's not optimal, but it's
acceptable.

1. All weapons choices should be part of a selection group called _*
Weapons *_. This keeps weapons choices together, and at the top of the
options window.

1. Use the Battle Brothers roster as an example of how to organize
things and do stuff.
